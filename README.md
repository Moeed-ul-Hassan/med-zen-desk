# 🧠 Clinic Management System — Internal Prototype (V0.1)

Welcome to the early stage of our internal **Clinic Management System** — a foundation for a smarter, data-driven healthcare workflow.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This prototype currently includes only the **Dashboard** and **Patient Management** modules.  
All other modules (Billing, Visit Records, Staff Scheduling, Messaging, Reporting) are under development and intentionally disabled.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Our goal is to build a single unified platform where **every clinic workflow** — from medical records to staff coordination and accounting — lives in one secure place.

This is **not** a public-facing portal.  
It’s designed **exclusively** for **clinic staff** to:
- record and retrieve patient data instantly,
- monitor internal activity in real time,
- eliminate dependency on paper and fragmented tools.
